My project is related to analyzing the multidecade drought in the Colorado River Basin.
I am using remote sensing data aided by hydrological modelling to observe the changes in hydrological conditions across the basin.
My work is also focused on finding the effect of soil moisture in mediating runoff response to snowpack.
